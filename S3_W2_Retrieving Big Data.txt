Querying Documents in MongoDB
By the end of this activity, you will be able to:
Find documents in MongoDB with specific field values.
Filter the results returned by MongoDB queries.
Count documents in a MongoDB collection and returned by queries. 

Step 1. Start MongoDB server and MongoDB shell. Open a terminal window by clicking on the square black box on the top left of the screen.

Next, change to the mongodb directory, and start the server:



The arguments --dbpath db specify that the directory db should be used for the MongoDB directory for datafiles. After starting the MongoDB server, you will see the following lines indicating that the server is running:

Next, let's run the MongoDB shell so that we can query the server. Open a new terminal shell window, change to the mongodb directory, and start the shell:




Step 2. Show Databases and Collections. Run the show dbs command to see the databases:

The database named sample has been created and loaded with Twitter JSON data. Let's switch to that database by running the use command:

We can see the collections in the sample database by running show collections:

The Twitter data is stored in the users collection. We can run db.users.count() to count the number of documents:


Step 3. Look at document and find distinct values. We can examine the contents of one of the documents by running db.users.findOne():

The document has several fields, e.g., user_name, retweet_count, tweet_ID, etc., and nested fields under user, e.g., CreatedAt, UserId, Location, etc.
We can find the distinct values for a specific field by using the distinct() command. For example, let's find the distinct values for user_name:


Step 4. Search for specific field value. We can search for fields with a specific value using the find() command. For example, let's search for user_name with the value ActionSportsJax:

By appending .pretty() to the end of the find command, the results will be formatted:


Step 5. Filter fields returned by query. We can specify a second argument to the find() command to only show specific field(s) in the result. Let's repeat the previous search, but only show the tweet_ID field:

The _id field is primary key for every document, and we can remove it from the results with the following filter:


Step 6. Perform regular expression search. MongoDB also supports searching documents with regular expressions. If we search for the value FIFA in the tweet_text field, there are no results:

However, if we search using a regular expression, there are many results:

The difference between the queries is that the first searched for where the tweet_text field value was exactly equal to FIFA, and the second searched for where the field value contained FIFA.
We can append .count() to the command to count the number of results:


Step 7. Search using text index. A text index can be created to speed up searches and allows advanced searches with $text. Let's create the index using createIndex():

The argument tweet_text specifies the field on which to create the index.
Next, we can use the $text operator to search the collection. We can perform the previous query to find the documents containing FIFA:

We can also search for documents not containing a specific value. For example, let's search for documents containing FIFA, but not Texas:


Step 8. Search using operators. MongoDB can also search for field values matching a specific criteria. For example, we can find where the tweet_mentioned_count is greater than six:

The $gt operator search for values greater than a specific value. We can use the $where command to compare between fields in the same document. For example, the following searches for tweet_mentioned_count is greater than tweet_followers_count:

Note that the field names for $where are required to be prefixed with this, which represent the document.
We can combine multiple searches by using $and. For example, let's search for tweet_text containing FIFA and tweet_mentioned_count greater than four:


When you are done querying MongoDB, run exit in the MongoDB shell, and Control-C in the terminal window running the server. 




Exploring Pandas DataFrames

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:
Read a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame
View the contents and shape of a DataFrame
Filter rows and columns of a DataFrame
Calculate the average and sum of a column in a DataFrame
Combine two DataFrames by joining on a single column

This activity consists of programming in a Jupyter Python Notebook. If you have not already started the Jupyter server, follow the instructions in the Reading entitled Starting Jupyter for Python Notebooks.

Step 1. Open a web browser and create a new Jupyter Python Notebook. Open a web browser by clicking on the web browser icon at the top of the toolbar: 

Navigate to localhost:8889/tree/Downloads/big-data-3:

Create a new Python Notebook by clicking on New, and then click on Python 3:


Step 2. Load Pandas and Read a CSV file into a DataFrame. We first load the Pandas library:

Note that to execute commands in Jupyter Notebooks, hold the <shift> key and press <enter>.
We can load the file buy-clicks.csv into a Pandas DataFrame:

This command assigns the DataFrame to a new variable named buyclicksDF, and reads the CSV using pandas.read_csv().

Step 3. View the contents and shape of a DataFrame. We can view the contents of the DataFrame by executing the variable:

Note that the Notebook does not display all the rows and displays the missing ones as .... :

We can view the first five rows by using the head(5) command: 

We can see how many rows and columns are in the DataFrame by looking at its shape:

The result says that there are 2947 rows and 7 columns.

Step 4. Filter rows and columns of a DataFrame. We can view only the price and userId columns of the DataFrame:

The [[ ]] creates a copy of the DataFrame with only the specified columns.
We can also filter rows based on a criteria. The following selects rows with a price less than 3:


Step 5. Calculate sum and average of a column. Pandas DataFrames provide many aggregation operations. We can calculate the total price:

We can also calculate the average price:

A complete list of statistical aggregation operations for Pandas DataFrames is at http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#computations-descriptive-stats

Step 6. Combine two DataFrames. We can combine two DataFrames on a single column. First, we will load ad-clicks.csv into a new DataFrame:

If we look at the contents, we see that adclicksDF also has a column named userId:

We can create a combine buyclicksDF and adclicksDF on the userId column with the following command:

The combined DataFrame is assigned to a new variable named mergeDF. The command adclicks.merge() combines adclicksDF with the first argument buyclicksDF, and on='userId' denotes which column to join on.
We can see that the combined DataFrame contains the columns from both adclicksDF and buyclicksDF:
